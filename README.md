## We use a bottom navigation to switch between fragments that each serve their own purpose.
## Fragment 1 is the Play Fragment which is where we will place our controller device on that will be usable to play on the arcade machine device.
## Fragment 2 is the Profile Fragment which will allow you to sign in and see your best score as well as submit your score to the overall leaderboard.
## Fragment 3 is the Score Fragment which will display the leaderboard and overall scores of all players up to a numbered amount

# Deliverable 2
## When you now open the app, you are placed on the Login Fragment, use username: admin and password: admin to log in
## If not, you can hit register and create a password inside of the Register Fragment
## There is a menu with settings that allows you to visit the Settings Fragment that currently doesn't have functionality
## Profile Fragment has runtime permission in order to access your phone gallery to place an image on the profile location
## New Push buttons on Play Fragment that currently have no functionality but will serve as controls alongside the joystick
## Score Fragment has no functionality but its the location of where we'll list the leaderboard and top scores
